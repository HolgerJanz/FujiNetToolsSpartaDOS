  FMOUNT D#: [slot R|W file]

Mounts or unmounts an ATR image, CAS,
or executable file to the device slot
D#:.

The host slot is specified by numbers
from 1 to 8.

The file is mounted from the host slot
in read (R/r) or write mode (W/w).

The current working directory of the
host slot is used to find the file
(see FCD).
NOTE: The current working directories
are not saved by FujiNet. At power on
all current working directories are
cleared and mounting slots depending
on current working directories will
fail.

A device slot is umounted if no file
and no options are specified e.g.,
  FMOUNT D#:

As with firmware version 0.5.daf2015f
2023-01-25 an unmounted drive will
not get offline.
